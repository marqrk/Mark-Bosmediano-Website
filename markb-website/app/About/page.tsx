            <p className="text-xl font-bold text-center pb-5">I am a 26 year old Computer Science graduate student who is working part time as a software developer for ARSome Tech. I live in NYC
                at 5921 Liebig Avenue, Bronx. </p>
            <p className="text-xl font-bold text-center pb-5">I have been coding since about 16, but my love for computers goes much further back; I have always been fascinated by
                computers, starting out with playing games on my parents' old Windows 98 computer. When I got to high school and saw that they were offering an introductory programming course,
                I jumped at the opportunity to learn the inner workings of the machines I had been using my entire life. Ever since then, I was hooked on coding. </p>
            <p className="text-xl font-bold text-center pb-5"> I worked hard, working part time while attending college in NYC. I graduated in 2022, with a BA in Computer Science from CUNY Hunter College.
                I graduated with skills in many languages like Python and C++, but more importantly I gained foundational knowledge that enabled me to quickly pick up and learn new languages and frameworks
                quickly, a skill I have put to great effect in my career and work in Graduate School. For example, I had never worked with Next.js before building this website, only base React, and
                using the documentation and other online resources I was able to create this simple website.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl font-bold text-center pb-50"> In my free time, my hobbies include video games (primarily PC gaming) and chatting with friends on discord. I am also a fan of trying new 
            foods and doing puzzle experiences like escape rooms.
